Problem in Voting System

In traditional voting:
Votes can be tampered with.
Lack of transparency makes voters distrustful.
Centralized authorities control the process.
Using Blockchain, we can store votes as immutable transactions. Each vote is transparent, cannot be altered, and anyone can verify the tally without exposing voter identity.

How Blockchain Solves Voting Problems

Immutability → Votes cannot be changed once recorded in a block.
Transparency → Every vote is visible on the blockchain (without revealing voter identity).
Security → Hashing ensures no tampering.
Decentralization → No single authority can manipulate results.
Auditability → Anyone can verify vote count by traversing the chain.
